Chatbot: Answer Questions from PDFs
This code implements a chatbot that can answer questions based on the content of a PDF document. It utilizes various libraries and techniques for text processing, vector search, and prompt-based chat generation.

Features:

Leverages pre-trained OpenAI embeddings for efficient text representation.
Stores document embeddings in a FAISS vector database for fast similarity search.
Employs a flexible prompting template for guiding chat generation.
Maintains conversation history to provide context for follow-up questions.
Usage:

Install dependencies: Ensure you have the required libraries installed (langchain, langchain-community, openai, etc.).
Load the code: Import the Chatbot class from the relevant Python file.
Create an instance: Initialize the Chatbot object with the path to your PDF document.
Ask a question: Call the chat_bot method with your question as input.
Get the answer: The method returns a text string containing the chatbot's response.
Example:

Python
from chatbot import Chatbot

chatbot = Chatbot("my_document.pdf")
answer = chatbot.chat_bot("What is the main topic discussed in section 3?")
print(answer)
Use code with caution.
Customization:

The code allows tweaking chunk size, search parameters, and prompting templates to fine-tune performance and behavior.
Experiment with different OpenAI models or explore alternative embedding techniques for potentially better results.
Additional Notes:

This is a basic implementation and could be extended with features like summarization, named entity recognition, or sentiment analysis.
Performance depends on hardware resources, PDF size, and question complexity.
Credits:

This code utilizes libraries from the langchain and langchain-community projects.
OpenAI provides the underlying language model capabilities.
Disclaimer:

This code is provided for educational purposes only.
Ensure proper usage and adherence to OpenAI's terms of service when using their API.
Future Improvements:

Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed content.
Explore integrating additional language models for enhanced response quality.
Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
I hope this README file provides a clear overview and usage guide for the chatbot code. Feel free to ask any further questions!
